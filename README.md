Inspired by my interests in quantitative finance, AI, and LLMs, I am customizing a fork of Lobe Chat to develop an innovative AI-powered framework for advanced financial analysis. Initiated on October 20, 2024, this project integrates state-of-the-art AI tools with finance-specific features designed to streamline data-driven analysis in finance, investment, and accounting.

*Note*: *The code remains private to maintain confidentiality as I refine and enhance this framework.*

### **Core Features**:
1. **File Upload & Knowledge Base**  
   Personal knowledge repository enabling efficient file upload and search, tailored for financial datasets (upload functionality currently under optimization).
   
2. **Multi-Model Support**  
   Integrated support for OpenAI and Anthropic models to provide versatile AI options.

3. **Advanced Infrastructure Optimizations**:
   - **Vercel**: Front-end deployment optimized for speed and cost efficiency; transitioning to **AWS** for enhanced performance and security.
   - **Cloudflare**: Added comprehensive security with DNS, CDN, and DDoS protection.
   - **MongoDB to AWS Migration**: Migrated database from MongoDB to AWS PostgreSQL for enhanced data management efficiency.
   - **Clerk Authentication**: Implemented secure, multi-provider login through GitHub and Google.

### **Current Challenges**:
- **Model Complexity Constraints**: Addressing limitations in context length for complex financial queries.
- **File Upload Bug ✅**: Finalizing network configurations for seamless file processing.
- **API Cost Optimization**: Focusing on cost-efficient API usage.
- **Data Quality Assurance ⏳**: Enhancing data input accuracy, essential for quality financial analysis.

### **Project Roadmap**:

1. **Short-Term (0-3 Months)**:
   - **PDF Generation & Code Execution ✅**: Embedding functionalities for on-demand report generation and real-time code execution.
   - **OpenBB Integration ⏳**: Integrate OpenBB for in-chat quantitative finance tools, facilitating deeper investment insights and the potential for AI-driven trading strategy recommendations.
   - **Cost Optimization Measures**: Experiment with caching strategies and intelligent API call routing to minimize expenses while maintaining performance.

2. **Mid-Term (3-6 Months)**:
   - **Custom Financial LLM Models**: Fine-tune local LLMs specifically for financial contexts, reducing reliance on external APIs and enhancing response accuracy.
   - **Advanced Analysis Modules**: Introduce specialized models for financial forecasting, portfolio risk analysis, and sensitivity analysis.
   - **Data Quality Enhancements**: Develop a preprocessing pipeline to ensure consistency and accuracy across various financial data inputs.

3. **Long-Term (6-12 Months)**:
   - **Enhanced Multi-User Collaboration**: Allow multiple users to upload, search, and analyze data collaboratively in real time, supporting finance teams.
   - **Automated Investment Insights & Alerts**: Implement alerting mechanisms for notable trends or anomalies in real-time data.
   - **Extended API Partnerships**: Explore additional API integrations (e.g., Refinitiv, Bloomberg) to provide enriched data for comprehensive financial analysis.

4. **Future Innovations (12+ Months)**:
   - **Integrated Financial Knowledge Graph**: Build a knowledge graph to uncover complex relationships between entities, events, and markets.
   - **Adaptive AI**: Employ reinforcement learning for the model to continuously improve based on past interactions and evolving financial contexts.
   - **Public/Private User Segmentation**: Develop user-access tiers, allowing tailored access to advanced financial insights based on user permissions.
