### **Custom LLM Framework for Financial Analysis**

*Lucas Kemper* – MSc Finance Student at HEC Lausanne

I am building a customized fork of **Lobe Chat**, an open-source UI framework for large language models (LLMs), to advance applications of AI in financial analysis. This project integrates cutting-edge AI tools with specialized financial functionalities, enhancing the framework to perform complex data-driven tasks in finance and investment.

**Note**: *The code is currently private to ensure privacy and security as I refine and test the framework.*

### **Core Features**:
1. **File Upload & Knowledge Base**  
   Created a personal knowledge repository with file upload and search functions, tailored for financial data and research materials (currently refining upload functionality).
   
2. **Multi-Model Support**  
   Configured the framework to interact with providers like OpenAI and Anthropic’s Claude, offering flexible, multi-provider AI solutions for financial queries.

3. **Advanced Optimizations**:
   - **Vercel**: Optimized for fast, reliable front-end deployment.
   - **Cloudflare**: Added enhanced DNS, CDN, and DDoS protection.
   - **MongoDB to AWS Migration**: Boosted data management efficiency by transitioning to AWS.
   - **Clerk Authentication**: Implemented secure, user-friendly login via GitHub and Google.

### **Current Challenges**:
- **API Cost Management**: Addressing high API usage to optimize costs.
- **Model Complexity**: Working within current context length limitations for more complex queries.
- **File Upload Bug**: Investigating network configuration for smoother file processing.

### **Roadmap**:
- **PDF Generation & Code Execution**: Embedding in the UI for on-demand report creation and real-time code execution.
- **OpenBB Integration**: Bringing financial analysis tools directly into the chat interface for deeper investment insights.
- **Customized Financial Models**: Developing local LLMs fine-tuned for financial contexts.
- **Cost Reduction**: Implementing optimizations to control API expenses.

This framework merges powerful open-source tools with custom enhancements to create a unique, private chatbot tailored for financial analysis and research.
