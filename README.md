**üìÑ Resume**: My detailed [resume](https://rebrand.ly/f6nwr7j)  is also available in this repository.


Driven by a passion for quantitative finance, AI, and LLMs, I am developing a customized fork of Lobe Chat, an open-source UI framework for large language models (LLMs), to advance applications of AI in financial analysis. This project, initiated on October 20, 2024, integrates cutting-edge AI tools with specialized financial functionalities to handle complex data-driven tasks in finance, investment & accounting.

**Note**: *The code is currently private to ensure privacy & security as I refine and test the framework.*

### **Core Features**:
1. **File Upload & Knowledge Base**  
   Created a personal knowledge repository with file upload and search functions, tailored for financial data and research materials (currently refining upload functionality).
   
2. **Multi-Model Support**  
   Configured the framework to interact with providers like OpenAI and Anthropic, offering flexible, multi-provider AI solutions. 

3. **Advanced Optimizations**:
   - **(Vercel)**: Optimized for fast, cost-effictive and reliable front-end deployment. Switching to AWS for better stability, performance & security ‚è≥
   - **Cloudflare**: Added enhanced (DNS, CDN, and DDoS protection,...)
   - **MongoDB**: Boosted data management efficiency by integrating MongoDB. (Switching to AWS (PostgreSQL). Migration successful ‚úÖ
   - **Clerk Authentication**: Implemented secure, user-friendly login via GitHub and Google.

### **Current Challenges**:
- **Model Complexity**: Working within current context length limitations of currently publicly available models (Gpt4o & Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet) for more complex queries.
- **File Upload Bug ‚úÖ**: Investigating network configuration for smoother file processing. 
- **API Cost Management**: Addressing high API usage to optimize costs.
- **Data Quality ‚è≥**: Ensuring accurate and reliable data inputs to maintain high-quality analysis, particularly when processing diverse financial datasets.



### **Roadmap**:
- **PDF Generation & Code Execution ‚úÖ**: Embedding in the UI for on-demand report creation and real-time code execution. 
- **OpenBB Integration ‚è≥**: Bringing quant financial analysis tools directly into the chat interface (using AI agents) for deeper investment insights. And possibly trading strategies.
- **Customized Financial Models ‚è≥**: Developing local LLMs fine-tuned for financial contexts.
- **Cost Reduction**: Implementing optimizations to control API expenses.

This framework merges powerful open-source tools with custom enhancements to create a unique, private chatbot tailored for financial analysis and research.
