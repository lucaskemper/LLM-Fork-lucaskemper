# 🤖 Custom LLM Framework for Financial Analysis (Public Version)

**Lucas Kemper** ([🌐 My Website](https://lucaskemper.com)) – First Year MScFin Student at HEC Lausanne, Switzerland 🇨🇭  

Inspired by my interests in **quantitative finance** 📊, **AI** 🧠, and **LLMs** 💬, I am customizing a fork of **Lobe Chat** to develop an innovative AI-powered framework for advanced financial analysis. Initiated on *October 20, 2024*, this project integrates state-of-the-art AI tools with finance-specific features designed to streamline data-driven analysis in **finance, investment,** and **accounting**.

> *Note*: *The code remains private to maintain confidentiality as I refine and enhance this framework.* 🔒
